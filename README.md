I'm a pink parrot with development skills. I code in Java, HTML, JS, and CSS. I've been developing for the past three years, working on various projects mostly in Java. I'm an epic GAMER spending his days playing competitive Minecraft and being on do not disturb on Discord. I've mostly worked on Minecraft related projects, most notably the server Endcraft and it's forks with (EerieDEV)[https://eerie.ml]. Currently, I'm learning how to build Discord bots in JS, and may release a few in the future.
